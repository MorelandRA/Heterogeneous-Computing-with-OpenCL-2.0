clGetPlatformIDs()
    Used to discover available OpenCL platforms on the system.

    cl_int
    clGetPlatformIDs(
        cl_uint num_entries,
        cl_platform_id *platforms,
        cl_uint *num_platforms)

    Calling it twice is more robust
        -> First call:
            num_entries = 0
            *platforms = NULL
            *num_platforms = an unsigned integer pointer
        <- Pointer is populated with the available number of platforms
        Then the programmer can allocate space to hold the platform IDs at *platforms
        -> Second call:
            num_entries = your desired number of platforms (up to the amount on the system)
            *platforms = the allocated memory space for the platform IDs
            *num_platforms = NULL
             and the desired number of platforms *num_platforms
        <- *platforms contains discovered platforms?

    In other words, clGetPlatformIDs does two things:
        1. sets any pointer in *num_platforms to point to the count of how many platforms there are
        2. sets any memory in *platforms to be the first (num_entries > 0) platform IDs

Next, we need to identify the available devices:

clGetDeviceIDs()
    Used to discover available OpenCL devices on a platform
    Works similarly to clGetPlatformIDs()

    cl_int
    clGetDeviceIDs(
        cl_platform_id platform.
        cl_device_type device_type,
        cl_uint num_entries,
        cl_device_id *devices,
        cl_uint *num_devices)

    device_type is used to limit devices to a certain type:
        CL_DEVICE_TYPE_GPU
        CL_DEVICE_TYPE_CPU
        CL_DEVICE_TYPE_ALL
        and other options
    this option should be the same for both calls to clGetDeviceIDs()


clGetPlatformInfo() and clGetDeviceInfo() can be used to print information about platforms and devices including
vendor, name, type, memory sizes, bus width, and more (shown on page 46).
