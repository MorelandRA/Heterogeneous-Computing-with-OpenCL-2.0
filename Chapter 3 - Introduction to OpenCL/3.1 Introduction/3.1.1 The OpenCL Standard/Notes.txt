By Apple in collaboration with AMD, IBM, Qualcomm, Inte, and NVIDIA, submitted to the Khronos group.
1.0 Released by Khronos Group in 2008.
    Defined the API and the C Kernel Language
1.1 and 1.2 enhanced OpenCL with OpenGL interoperability, additional image formats, synchronization events, and
device partitioning
2.0 in November 2013
    Shared virtual memory, nested parallelism, and generic address spaces
    Could simply development and improve portability performance
Khronos Group manages competing interests across vendors, and keeps OpenCL portable

OpenCL C is a restricted version of C99, with some extensions for parallelism.
    Also includes some C11 features like atomics and synchronization

    3rd party bindings exist for Java, C++, Python, and .NET

    Some libraries for linear algebra and computer vision leverage OpenCL for performance
