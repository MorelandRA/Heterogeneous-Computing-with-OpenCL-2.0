The specification is divided into four parts, which the next sections will elaborate on:

Platform Model:
    There is one host processor, which coordinates execution (sends out kernels)
    There is one or more device processors, which execute OpenCL kernels

    Example: a host x86 CPU with a GPU acting as an accelerator

Execution Model:
    Configuration of the environment, including how it's defined, how host and devices communicate, and the
    concurrency model (How an algorithm is broken into work items / groups).

    Example: host sets up a kernel for the GPU and sends commands

Kernel Programming Model:
    How the concurrency model is mapped to hardware

    Example: GPU creates hardware threads, and maps them to units.

Memory Model:
    Defines object types and the memory hierarchy (independent of the memory architecture), as well as memory ordering
    requirements and any shared virtual memory between host and devices.

    Example: Programmer allocates abstract memory, which gets mapped to physical memory

Chapter begins by describing the host API, by introducing OpenCL models and the associated API.
Then, it is demonstrated by a vector addition program
The program will then be used to demo the OpenCL C++ API, and will be compared to the CUDA implementation.
