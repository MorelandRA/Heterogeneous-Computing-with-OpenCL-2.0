The grain is how much work is done by a thread. A larger grain = more work relative to the amount of interthread
communication; also known as chunk size, and choosing your grain is referred to as chunking.

Fine Grained with a Large Number of Tasks:
    Compute intensity needs to be moderate so that each thread has a sufficient amount of work
    Communication cost needs to be low
    Workload scheduling is important (when you have more tasks than threads)

Coarse-Grained:
    Compute intensity will be higher
    Larger work items have to be identified to be parallel by the programmer

The most efficient granularity depends on the algorithm and the hardware, but generally, if the communication cost
is high, it's better to have larger chunks.

SIMD: Single Instruction, Multiple Data
    Extremely fine grained (single instruction)
    Requires a large vector (data set) to make up for communication time

SPMD (Single Program, Multiple Data) takes the same idea but applies it to larger programs.
