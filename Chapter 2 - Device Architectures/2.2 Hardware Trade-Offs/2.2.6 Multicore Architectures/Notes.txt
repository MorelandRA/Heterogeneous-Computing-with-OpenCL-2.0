Basic concept is to have multiple CPU cores all interacting with the same memory system. This is an old technique
and can massively increase performance.

What is and isn't a core can be hard to define.

Standard CPUs tend to have multiple execution components acting independently and in parallel, but this typically
wouldn't be considered multicore.

Higher end CPUs might have multiple cores sharing functional units.

Similarly, GPUs can have lots of cores, on the scale of 32-64 ( as of writing the book; probably dated)
Some designs follow an approach similar to multicore CPUs
Others take a different approach, using many SIMD cores to execute ALU operations.
Instruction scheduling, decode, and dispatch are handled by the wave scheduler units.
    Wave schedules are named for the wide SIMD thread context called a Wavefront
