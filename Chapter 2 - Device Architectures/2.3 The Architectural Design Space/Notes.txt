Many architectures have unique designs and don't fit the exact design definitions mentioned in 2.2.
The point being that the way we think about architectures can be overly simplistic, such as considering
all CPUs to be serial, GPUs to be purely parallel, core count, thread count.
Instead, there is a lot of variation in designs.

This section discusses some real architectures and the design decisions around them, which gives insight on
how algorithms will perform on them.
