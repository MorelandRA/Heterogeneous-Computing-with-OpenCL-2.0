An OpenCL program is a collection of:
- OpenCL C kernels
- functions called by the kernel
- constant data

OpenCL code is compiled at runtime, so the system can optimize the kernels for the specific device that it's running on

Process for creating a kernel from source code:
1. OpenCL C source code is stored in a character array
    if the source is stored in a file on a disk, it first has to be read to memory
2. Source is turned into a program object cl_program with clCreateProgramWithSource()
3. The program is compiled for 1+ devices with clBuildProgram().
    If there are compile errors, this is when they will be reported
4. Kernel object cl_kernel is created with clCreateKernel()
    clCreateKernel requires the program object and a name for the kernel

    cl_kernel
    clCreateKernel(
        cl_program program,
        const char *kernel_name,
        cl_int *errcode_ret)

Vendors will use clBuildProgram() to generate vendor-specific instruction sets.

clGetProgramInfo() will return information about program objects.
    using the CL_PROGRAM_BINARIES flag will return the vendor-specific generated binary.

clCreateProgramWithBinary() can then be used to distribute OpenCL programs without sharing plain text kernel source code

Kernel arguments can not be passed all at once. Instead, we have to pass the arguments one at a time:

cl_int
clSetKernelArg (
    cl_kernel kernel //the kernel which we are passing an argument to
    cl_uint arg_index //the index of the kernel's parameter which we are passing an argument to
    size_t arg_size //the size of the object we are passing as an argument
    const void *arg_value) //the object we are passing as an argument
