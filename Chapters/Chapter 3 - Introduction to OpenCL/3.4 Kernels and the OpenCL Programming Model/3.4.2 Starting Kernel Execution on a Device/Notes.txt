clEnqueueNDRangeKernel()
    enqueue an N-Dimensional kernel to your command queue
    returns back as soon as the kernel is on the command queue, likely before execution has begun

    cl_int
    clEnqueueNDRangeKernel(
        cl_command_queue command_queue, //Specifies the target device
        cl_kernel kernel, //The code to be executed
        cl_uint work_dim, //number of dimensions for work items (limited to 1, 2, or 3)
        const size_t *global_work_offset, //offset so that work item IDs don't start at 0
        const size_t *local_work_size, //num of work items per dimension
        cl_uint num_events_in_wait_List, //number of items in the wait list
        const cl_event *event_wait_list, //prereq items before this event can run
        cl_event *event //current status of the kernel
    )

See section 3.3.3 for more details on events and the wait list

clWaitForEvents() or clFinish can be used to make the host wait for kernels to complete.
