If the amount of work to be dispatched can't be determined statically by the host, such as in algorithms where
each stage depends on the previous one, older versions of OpenCL would require the device to tell the host
the information that it needed to approximate the size of the next kernel.

However, OpenCL 2.0 supports device-side enqueuing

Now, kernels (parent kernels) can enqueue other kernels (child kernels) into a device-side command-queue.
These are processed asynchronously, but the parent isn't complete until the children are.

Device-side command-queue is an out-of-order command-queue, and acts the same as the host's out-of-order queue.
    Device-side commands use events to enforce dependencies
    These events are only visible to the parent.

Chapter 5 elaborates on device-side enqueuing
