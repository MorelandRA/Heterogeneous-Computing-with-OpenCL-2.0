Tasks are performed based on commands sent from the host to the device.
Command actions include executing kernels, data transfers, and synchronization
Devices can also send commands to themselves, which is discussed later in the chapter (3.3.4 Device-Side Enqueuing)

A command-queue is how a host requests actions from the device.

One command-queue is created per device, so that the host can send commands to multiple devices when multiple are
present.

clCreateCommandQueueWithProperties()
    Creates a command-queue associated with a device.

    cl_command_queue
    clCreateCommandQueueWithProperties(
        cl_context context,
        cl_device_id device,
        cl_command_queue_properties properties,
        cl_int *errcode_ret)

    properties is a bit field which can be used to enable profiling commands or allow out-of order execution commands
        CL_QUEUE_PROFILING_ENABLE
        CL_QUEUE_OUT_OF_ORDER_EXEC_MODE_ENABLE
    These are discussed in Chapter 5

In-order command-queues pull commands from the queue in the order that they are received.
    Kernels are parallel but commands are serial

Out-of-order command-queues allow OpenCL to search for commands tht can be rearranged to execute more efficiently,
but the programmer has to handle synchronization so that the correct execution order is enforced.
    Kernels and commands are both parallel, up to the point of programmer-defined synchronization

API calls that issue commands to the command-queue start with "clEnqueue" and are passed a command-queue

    clEnqueueNDRangeKernel()
        requests that a kernel is executed on the device

    clEnqueueReadBuffer()
        requests the device to send data to the host

    These commands are discussed in detail later on (Sections 3.4.2 and 3.5.2 respectively)

Barrier functions can be usd to synchronize execution
    cl_int clFlush(cl_command_queue command_queue)
        Waits until all commands have been started (but not necessarily finished executing)
    cl_int clFinish(cl_command_queue command_queue)
        Waits until all commands in the queue have been executed
