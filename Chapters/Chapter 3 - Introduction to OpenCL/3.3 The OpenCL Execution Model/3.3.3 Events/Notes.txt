Events specify dependencies between commands

All events have three parameters in common:
    A pointer to a list of events which are dependencies for the current command (known as a wait list)
    The number of events in the waitlist
    A pointer to an event that represents the execution of the current command

    Specifying dependencies for events is discussed in more detail in chapter 5

Events also allow the programmer to query the status of a command at any time; the status is updated as the command
is processed. Possible states are:
    Queued: It's on the command-queue
    Submitted: Out of the command-queue, submitted to the device
    Ready: Ready for execution
    Running: Execution has started
    Ended: Execution is finished
    Complete: Child commands have also finished

    Child commands are related to device-side enqueuing and are discussed in the next section, section 3.3.4.

    Status will be a negative value if the command was unsuccessful.
        This command-queue and other command-queues in the context may no longer be available.
            (A context may have multiple devices, therefore multiple command queues, since it's one per device)

clGetEventInfo()
    Queries an event's status

clWaitForEvents()
    Host must wait for all specified events to complete execution

    cl_int
    clWaitForEvents(
        cl_uint num_events,
        const cl_event *event_list)
