OpenCL's platform models (Sections 3.2-3.5) are exposed to programmers by their APIs
    Platform Model: enables a host and 1+ devices to execute an OpenCL application
    Programming Model: OpenCL kernels defined by the programmer
    Memory Model: How a kernel manipulates data
    Execution Model: allows issuing of commands to devices

This section combines all of those concepts into an example, following these steps:

1. Discover the platform and devices
2. Create a context
3. Create a command-queue per device
4. Creating memory objects to hold data
5. Copy input data to a device
6. Create and compile a program
7. Extract the kernel from the program
8. Execute the kernel
9. Copy output data to the host
10. Release resources

Much of the OpenCL setup code is generic and reusable.

This section includes a lot of source code an explanation, but I will include these notes as comments in 3.6.1 with the
full vector addition example.
