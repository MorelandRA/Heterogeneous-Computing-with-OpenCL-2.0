Since architectures can vary widely in how they manage memory, OpenCL abstracts the memory model for programmers,
and vendors map this abstract memory model to their architecture's actual memory model.

With the abstract memory model, OpenCL can provide expectations for programmers:
    order of memory operations
    which memory values each read operation will return

Chapters 6 and 7 elaborate on the OpenCL memory model
This section focuses on the basics; OpenCL's memory object types, and regions of OpenCL's abstract memory model
