Kernels normally need some input data, and generate some output data.
Input data needs to be accessible by the device, and output data needs to be accessible by the host.
Memory objects allow this data to be transferred between the two
There are three types of memory objects: buffers, images, and pipes

BUFFERS
-------
Equivalent to arrays

clCreateBuffer()
    allocates space for the buffer, returns a memory object

    cl_mem
    clCreateBuffer(
        cl_context context, //visible for all devices associated with the context
        cl_mem_flags flags, //read-only, write-only, or read-write, etc
        size_t size, //size of the buffer
        void *host_ptr, //optional based on the flag; allows allocating, copying, or directly using host memory
        cl_int *errcode_ret //error response
    )


IMAGES
------
Abstracts image data to allow for device-specific optimizations
Images can not be directly referenced like arrays can
Not guaranteed to be stored contiguously

clCreateImage()
    allocates space for the image, returns a memory object

    cl_mem
    clCreateImage(
        cl_context context, //visible for all devices associated with the context
        cl_mem_flags flags, //read-only, write-only, or read-write, etc
        const cl_image_format *image_format, //How the image is stored in memory
        const cl_image_desc *image_desc, //Metadata such as type, size, etc
        void *host_ptr, //optional based on the flag; allows allocating, copying, or directly using host memory
        cl_int *errcode_ret //error response
    )

Example is in chapter 4
Architectural design and tradeoffs in chapters 6 and 7


PIPES
-----
A queue, where max-one kernel can read from, and max-one kernel can write to. These can not be the same kernel.
Accessed using OpenCL's intrinsic read_pipe() and write_pipe() functions

clCreatePipe()
    allocates space for the pipe, returns a memory object

    cl_mem
    clCreatePipe(
        cl_context context, //visible for all devices associated with the context
        cl_mem_flags flags, //read-only, write-only, or read-write, etc
        cl_uint pipe_packet_size, //size of a packet, or a single item in the queue
        cl_uint max_packets, //max number of packets, or the max size of the queue
        const cl_pipe_properties *properties, //Does nothing, reserved for future use/extensibility. Pass NULL
        cl_int *errcode_ret //error response
    )

Pipes are described in more detail in Chapter 6
