Memory is either Host Memory or Device Memory.

Host memory is memory that is directly available to the host, and is defined outside of OpenCL, such as by malloc

Device memory is divided into four different regions:
    Global Memory:
        Visible to all work items executing a kernel
        Data transferred between the host and device is global
    Constant Memory:
        Like global where anything can read it including the host
        All work-items may read it simultaneously because it is a constant value; no race conditions
        Uses the keyword "constant" or "__constant"
    Local Memory:
        Shared between work items in a work group
        Normally mapped to on-chip memory (but, it's up to the vendor)
        Scratchpad memory
        Much shorter latency / higher bandwidth than global memory
        clSetKernelArg() with a size but no arg allows the host to allocate local memory at runtime
        "local" or "__local" keywords can define local memory from within a kernel
        Arrays can also be generated like this but the size must be statically declared at compile time
    Private Memory:
        Unique to an individual work-item
        Local variables and nonpointer kernel args are private by default
        Normally mapped to registers
            Private arrays and spilled registers are mapped to long-latency memory (off-chip)

Diagrams 3.6 and 3.7 on pages 61 and 62 give a visual for some of these concepts
