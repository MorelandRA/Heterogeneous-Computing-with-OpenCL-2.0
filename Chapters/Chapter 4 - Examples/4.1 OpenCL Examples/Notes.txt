This chapter goes over some basic OpenCL examples
This will summarize Chapter 3 and demonstrate what is needed to write complete OpenCL applications.

Later chapters will use this chapter as a reference for further optimization.

Focuses of each example:
    Histogram
        Local Memory
        Local Atomics
        Global Atomics
        Barriers
        Memory Fences
    Image Rotation:
        Images
        Samplers
    Image Convolution
        C++ API
        Constant Memory
        Images
        Samplers
    Producer-Consumer
        Pipes
        Multiple Devices
