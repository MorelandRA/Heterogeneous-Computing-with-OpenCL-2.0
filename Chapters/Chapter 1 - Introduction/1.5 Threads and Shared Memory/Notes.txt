A process can have subprocesses which can run concurrently, called threads.
Threads share resources such as memory, open-files, and globals, but also have their own resources such as stack and
automatic variables.
Threads can communicate using globals, but this requires synchronization to ensure that multiple threads aren't
changing the same memory location at the same time.
