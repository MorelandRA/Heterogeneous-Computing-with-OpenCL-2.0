Threads can be used to run different independent instruction streams at the same time.

The difficult part is having an extra instruction stream and maintaining registers/cache between them.

Simultaneous Multithreading:
    Instructions between multiple threads are both executed when there is availability.

    Diagram on page 23, but the idea is that when one instruction stream doesn't need an ALU, the other instruction
    stream may use it. Leverages superscalar execution

Temporal Multithreading:
    Round-robin instruction processing. Scheduling is made easy and easily scaled with more threads.

    Diagrams on pages 24 and 25
