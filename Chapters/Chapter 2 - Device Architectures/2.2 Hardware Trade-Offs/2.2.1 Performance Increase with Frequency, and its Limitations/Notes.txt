The easiest way to write code is to perform one task after another (serially) but it's harder to write parallel code.

Performance increase with frequency is less-than-linear, which is why frequency improvements get increasingly harder
to make. Therefore, to significantly improve compute times, we instead have to perform more operations at once.
