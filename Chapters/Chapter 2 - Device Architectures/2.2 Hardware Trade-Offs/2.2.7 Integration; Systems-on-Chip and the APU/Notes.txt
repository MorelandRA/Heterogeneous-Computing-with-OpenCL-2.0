For embedded systems where it's important to use low power, systems-on-chip (SoCs) combine components, optimizing
for the specific use case.

SoCs allow:
    combined elements = lower manufacturing costs
    smaller physical space
    combined elements = smaller distances = less power, easier data sharing, lower latency

Cell phones combine the ARM instruction set architecture, a mobile GPU, memory controllers, and more onto one chip

An Accelerated Processing Unit (APU) combines CPU and GPU onto one chip.
