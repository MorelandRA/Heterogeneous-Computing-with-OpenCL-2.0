OpenCL originated for graphics APIs / pixel shaders

What's a gpu and how does it differ from other devices?
    How many cores does a GPU have to have?
        What's a core?
        What's a many-core device?
        What's a multicore device?

Multicore CPUs maintain the speeds of single-core CPUs with extra processing power and limited electrical power

SIMD and Very Long Instruction Word (VLIW) improve work rates by improving the ratio of arithmetic operations vs
control logic.

Multithreading lets computing work happen while non-computing work is waiting.

All approaches have trade-offs, but heterogeneity allows multiple approaches to be used and to get the best of all
worlds.
