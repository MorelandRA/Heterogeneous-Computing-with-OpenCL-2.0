SoCs (Systems-on-Chip) are being used for more high-performance applications
Mostly combining CPUs and GPUs, but also video decoders, random number generators, and encryption circuits
Offers power savings overall by moving these calculations to special chips rather than needing the GPU to do it

AMD:
    Low power, low-end: Beema and Mullins
        Based on the Puma CPU, combined with a low-end GPU
        Single die
    Higher performance: Kaveri
        Based on the Steamroller core and a higher performance GPU

Intel: i7
    Based on 4 cores of the Haswell microarchitecture and an HD GPU
    Full OpenCL/DirectX 11 Capabilities

APU allows transfer between CPU and GPU efficiently, solving a major GPU bottleneck
More tightly integrated CPU-GPU algorithms can leverage this
    Not practical for standard architectures
Loses the high bandwidth memory of standard GPUs
Advantage comes when calculations are bottlenecked by communication
